## Description about the overall project.

The tourism industry can contribute significantly to developing a country’s economy. The tourism industry mainly generates new job opportunities in various sectors, such as hotels, restaurants, transportation, and entertainment. This can lead to increased income for individuals and contribute to the country's overall economic growth and tourism can bring foreign currency into a country through expenditure by tourists on accommodation, food, shopping, and other activities. This can contribute to the country's foreign exchange reserves, which can be used for various purposes like importing petroleum, essential medicines, foodstuff, fertilizers, and auto parts, etc. As well as the tourism industry can also contribute to the government’s revenue through taxes on tourism-related goods and services, such as value-added taxes and taxes on visas. This tax revenue can also be invested by the government for the well-being of the people of the country.
At present, the lack of foreign exchange (due to which, the delay in payment of foreign exchange and import of essential materials) and unemployment can be identified as some main economic problems in Sri Lanka.
Therefore, our group decided to develop a mobile application solution called “Visit Sri Lanka”, with the aim of increasing the amount of foreign exchange flowing into the country through foreign tourists and providing a solution to unemployment. It includes the following four main components.
01.	Functionality for foreigners registration and sharing tour experiences with other users of the application.
02.	Taxi Driver Management System.
03.	Hotel Management System.
04.	Tour Guide Registration and Selecting Tour Guides
These four main components are implemented by the members of group.
